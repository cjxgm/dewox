dewox - An RAD [de]momaker inspired by [W]erkkzeug for [O]penGL & Linu[x]
======================================================================
<h3>Dewox wiki is in Chinese now!</h3>

The only usable modern demomaker is .werkkzeug from .theprodukkt, but
it's Windows only. So I decided to write one like that for linux.

Dewox is a C project written under OpenGL and OpenAL. The backend of
windowing system is now GLUT. I'll implement a glX one when it get
almost done.

Dewox uses scons to build itself. See INSTALL for more details.
