dewox - An RAD [de]momaker inspired by [W]erkkzeug for [O]penGL & Linu[x]
======================================================================
The only usable modern demomaker is .werkkzeug from .theprodukkt, but
it's Windows only. So I decided to write one like that for linux.

dewox is written under OpenGL and OpenAL. The backend of windowing system
is now GLUT. I'll implement a glX one when it get almost done.
