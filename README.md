dewox - An RAD [de]momaker inspired by [W]erkkzeug for [O]penGL & Linu[x]
======================================================================
The only usable modern demomaker is .werkkzeug from .theprodukkt, but
it's Windows only. So I decided to write one like that for linux.

FAQ
======================================================================
	Q: I noticed that you wrote demolino already, why yet another one?
	A: Demolino is for C++, and this one is a RAD application that you
	   don't need to program to use.

	Q: Where can I get more information?
	A: See the dewox wiki.
